Please note that in the requirements.txt file that the version of torch
said to be required is 1.2.0. While this should work fine, if any issues arise
relating to torch, try installing a newer version of torch. This was done during experimentation
because of issues relating to GPU usage with newer versions of torch for the bert embeddings.
