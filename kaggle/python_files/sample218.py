# There is a nice separation between various groups of customers, but not so between 0/1 categories within each group. This is somewhat exaggerated by the fact that "0" points (blue) are plotted first and "1" points (red) are plotted last. There seems to be more red than blue in that image, even though there are >25x "0" points in reality. I'd be grateful if someone knows how to plot this in a way that would not create this misleading impression.
# 
# Regardless, 0/1 points are not separated well at all. That means that they will not be easy to classify, which we all know by now.

# **[t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/)** could potentially lead to better data separation/visualization, because unlike PCA it preserves the local structure of data points. The problem with sklearn implementation of t-SNE is its lack of memory optimization. I am pretty sure that the t-SNE code at the very bottom will lead to memory errors on most personal computers, but I leave it commented out if anyone wants to try.
# 
# Instead, I ran t-SNE using a much faster and more memory-friendly commandline version, which can be found at the link above.
# 
# Here is the output of that exercise:
# 
# ![](https://i.imgur.com/7EqkUWH.png)

# Again, we can see clear separation between different groups of customers. Some groups even have a nice "coffee bean" structure where two subgroups can be identified (gender?). Alas, there is no clear separation between 0/1 categories.
# 
# In strictly technical terms, we are screwed :D

# I think that's a better plot visually and there is a good number of well-defined clusters, but still no clear separation between 0/1 points.
# 
# We can red-do the t-SNE plot as well using modified dataset. **Don't try this at home** - it takes 24+ hours using a commandline version of bh_tsne.
# 
# Anyway, here is the new t-SNE plot:
# 
# ![](https://i.imgur.com/HYR699D.png)
# 
# Again, lots of interesting clusters, but blue and red dots overlap for the most part.

# This just happens to be a difficult classification classification problem, so maybe it is not a big surprise that raw data does not contain enough info for t-SNE to distinguish clearly between the classes.
# 
# Unfortunately, it is not much better even after training. Below is a t-SNE plot of activations from the last hidden layer (3rd) of a neural network that was trained on this dataset for 80 epochs. If you download the full version (it is roughly 10.5 x 10.5 inches), you may be able to see better that lots of red dots are concetrated in the lower left quadrat (6-9 on a clock dial), and that there are clearly fewer red dots in the upper right quadrant (0-3 on a clock dial). So the network has succeded somewhat in sequestering the red dots, but they still overlap quite a bit with blue ones.

# Later I will have more t-SNE plots from neural network activations in [__this kernel__](https://www.kaggle.com/tilii7/keras-averaging-runs-gini-early-stopping).
