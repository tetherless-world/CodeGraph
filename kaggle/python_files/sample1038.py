# it seems we are getting a good score if we use the variable 'technical_20' and build a model. However if we use the top 4 variables and build a model, we are getting a negative public score though our local validation score improved to 0.0195. So how do we tackle this?
# 
# Also from the kagglegym api, we get the rewards (R value) for individual timestamps and finally for the whole test data set. These individual rewards are very hard to make sense since it is highly influenced by the mean target value of the given timestamp. 
# 
# So I thought probably **looking at the cumulative R value till the given timestamp** might help a little more (as mean target values are averaged over all the points till the given timestamp) to build a more robust model and here is an attempt to understand the performance of some of the top public scripts.

# The macro trend remains almost similar. R value of both the models dip below 0 in the intermediate time stamps and is above zero towards the end.
# 
# But we can also clearly notice that there is some variability in the Extra Tress model when compared with the ridge model. I think this helps in the model prediction when both are combined together. I also think this is the reason we are getting an improvement in the public LB score. 
# 
# **Inferences:**
# 
# If we could build a model which predicts good for the sub-zero R value timestamps (my hunch says it is hard though) and combine it with our existing best performing public models, it may be a good way to hedge the risk of overfitting.
# 
# Combining many models together might also be helpful to combat the overfitting risk (as it is proved by the best public script as well).
