# In this kernel, I'm trying to obtain a baseline for the following model:
# 1. Use a pre-trained version for the BERT transformer model to obtain contextual word embeddings for the 3 target words in each passage: A, B and Pronoun.
# 2. Feed this into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which learns to solve the coreference resolution problem as a supervised classification task.
# 
# I'm using the [GitHub repo for the BERT project ](https://github.com/google-research/bert) to obtain the pre-trained model. See also the [BERT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) by Devlin et al. The idea for the architecture (1-2 above) comes from the [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzSgnRcKX) "What do you learn from context? Probing for sentence structure in contextualized word representations" by Tenney et al. For coreference resolution, they use the OntoNotes and Definite Pronoun Resolution datasets, but not GAP. As such, the MLP hyperparameters they use may not be the best for our current task. The hyperparameters I use below are quite different from theirs.
# 
# The data I'm using comes from the 3 GAP files available [here](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/gap-coreference). The gap-development file contains the same data as the test_stage_1 file that we're trying to make predictions on. Of course, gap-development also contains the true labels, but I'm not using these when making predictions. I only use the true labels to evaluate the predictions made by my model. The other two files, gap-test and gap-validation, are used for training the model.
# 
# **Updates V7**:
# In the previous version, I was a little worried by the large variance of the model. The current version uses a much smaller MLP for the supervised classification problem, with more regularization. This achieves the same mean CV score, with lower variance. Specifically, the current MLP has:
# - only one hidden layer of size 37, down from two hidden layers of sizes [59,31]
# - dropout rate of 0.6 in the hidden layer, up from 0.5
# - L2 regularization in the output layer of 0.1, up from 0.05
# 
# Ceshine Lee independently published a kernel with a very neat PyTorch implementation of the same idea. You can check it out [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ceshine/pytorch-bert-baseline-public-score-0-54).
