# This Kernal implements a Keras + Tensorflow CNN for the StatOil Iceberg competition. It has yielded results of 0.1995 on the leaderboard. With some tuning and image filtering plus more of an inclusion of the incident angle, a better result could be yielded I'm sure.
# 
# The input is a 75x75x3 set of images. The output is a binary 0/1 where 1 is noteed as an iceberg. 
# 
# The set of images are band_1 (HH), band_2 (HV), and an combined band which would be (HH dot HV)/constant. However, since we are working with the images in dB, the 3rd band is modified to compenate for the log function yielding band_1 + band_2 -log(constant). The last term is neglected as when the images are scaled the 3rd term would be removed by the mathematics anyway.

# ## Adding images for training

# Now, the biggest improvement I had was by adding more data to train on. I did this by simply including horizontally and vertically flipped data. Using OpenCV this is easily done.

# ## CNN Keras Model

# Now the nitty gritty of the situation, the CNN model. This is a simplistic model that should give reasonable results. It is not tuned that well and there are plenty of options and changes you can try so as to improve it. At least you will get the idea:

# In[ ]:


def getModel():
    #Build keras model
    
    model=Sequential()
    
    # CNN 1
    model.add(Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3),activation='relu', input_shape=(75, 75, 3)))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(3, 3), strides=(2, 2)))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))

    # CNN 2
    model.add(Conv2D(128, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu' ))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), strides=(2, 2)))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))

    # CNN 3
    model.add(Conv2D(128, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), strides=(2, 2)))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))

    #CNN 4
    model.add(Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), strides=(2, 2)))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))

    # You must flatten the data for the dense layers
    model.add(Flatten())

    #Dense 1
    model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))

    #Dense 2
    model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))

    # Output 
    model.add(Dense(1, activation="sigmoid"))

    optimizer = Adam(lr=0.001, decay=0.0)
    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    return model

# Now get the model and get ready to train

# In[ ]:


model = getModel()
model.summary()

batch_size = 32
earlyStopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=10, verbose=0, mode='min')

# Now train the model! (Each epoch ran at about 10s on GPU)

# In[ ]:


model.fit(Xtr_more, Ytr_more, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=50, verbose=1, callbacks=[earlyStopping, mcp_save, reduce_lr_loss], validation_split=0.25)

# ## Results

# Load the best weights and check the score on the training data.

# In[ ]:


model.load_weights(filepath = '.mdl_wts.hdf5')

score = model.evaluate(Xtrain, Ytrain, verbose=1)
print('Train score:', score[0])
print('Train accuracy:', score[1])

# Now, to make a submission, load the test data and train the model and output a csv file.

# In[ ]:


df_test = pd.read_json('../input/test.json')
df_test.inc_angle = df_test.inc_angle.replace('na',0)
Xtest = (get_scaled_imgs(df_test))
pred_test = model.predict(Xtest)

submission = pd.DataFrame({'id': df_test["id"], 'is_iceberg': pred_test.reshape((pred_test.shape[0]))})
print(submission.head(10))

submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)

# The best submission with this I received was 0.1995 on the leaderboard. Have a go and see how well you can do!
