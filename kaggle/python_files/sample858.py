# The previously suggested Lung Segmentation methods in the challenge Kernels mainly involve thresholding the lung tissue based on its hounsfield value and using morphological dilation to include nodules in border regions. These methods have the severe drawback of also including lots of tissue that is neither lung, nor a region of interest. I coded up an algorithm based on the one presented in R Shojaii et al (2005, DOI: 10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530294) with some modifications, that I will present here. Some preprocessing and presentation code for this is also taken from the Kernels presented by Guido Zuidhof and ArnavJain. Lots of thanks to them for sharing their code.

# In order to use marker based watershed segmentation, we need to identify two markers. An internal marker, that is definitely lung tissue and an external marker, that is definitely outside of our ROI. We're starting by creating the internal marker by thresholding the Image and removing all regions but the biggest one. The external marker is created by morphological dilation of the internal marker with 2 different iterations and subtracting the results. A watershed marker is created superimposing the 2 markers with different grayscale values.

# Now we apply the marker based Watershed algorithm to find the precise border of the Lung located in the Black strip of the Watershed marker shown above. In order to do the algorithm we also need the Sobel-Gradient-Image of our original scan, which is calculated first.
# 
# In order to not miss nodules located next to the border regions a Black Top Hat Operation is performed to re-include those areas and areas surrounding the lung-hili. This is the main advantage of this method here over the methods from other kernels: Only areas that need re-inclusion get dilated, everywhere else the lung border stays precise.

# The resulting images of this code are still in the original dimensions of the CT Scan and in Hounsfield Units with the filtered areas being assigned -2000.
# 
# This method of lung segmentation preserves the original lung border very precisely while re-including possible nodule candidates in border regions. The main downside is the much longer processing time per patient.

# Please note in the end: I'm a c# exile, so my code might not be the fastest or most pythonesque. Please excuse this.
