# First we will read in the csv's so we can see some more information on the filenames and breeds

# Next we will read in all of the images for test and train, using a for loop through the values of the csv files. I have also set an im_size variable which sets the size for the image to be re-sized to,  90x90 px, you should play with this number to see how it affects accuracy.

# We can see above that there are 120 different breeds. We can put this in a num_class variable below that can then be used when creating the CNN model.

# It is important to create a validation set so that you can gauge the performance of your model on independent data, unseen to the model in training. We do this by splitting the current training set (x_train_raw) and the corresponding labels (y_train_raw) so that we set aside 30 % of the data at random and put these in validation sets (X_valid and Y_valid).
# 
# * This split needs to be improved so that it contains images from every class, with 120 separate classes some can not be represented and so the validation score is not informative. 

# In[ ]:


X_train, X_valid, Y_train, Y_valid = train_test_split(x_train_raw, y_train_raw, test_size=0.3, random_state=1)

# Now we build the CNN architecture. Here we are using a pre-trained model VGG19 which has already been trained to identify many different dog breeds (as well as a lot of other objects from the imagenet dataset see here for more information: http://image-net.org/about-overview). Unfortunately it doesn't seem possible to downlod the weights from within this kernel so make sure you set the weights argument to 'imagenet' and not None, as it currently is below.
# 
# We then remove the final layer and instead replace it with a single dense layer with the number of nodes corresponding to the number of breed classes we have (120).

# In[ ]:


# Create the base pre-trained model
# Can't download weights in the kernel
base_model = VGG19(#weights='imagenet',
    weights = None, include_top=False, input_shape=(im_size, im_size, 3))

# Add a new top layer
x = base_model.output
x = Flatten()(x)
predictions = Dense(num_class, activation='softmax')(x)

# This is the model we will train
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# First: train only the top layers (which were randomly initialized)
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

callbacks_list = [keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_acc', patience=3, verbose=1)]
model.summary()

# In[ ]:


model.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs=1, validation_data=(X_valid, Y_valid), verbose=1)

# Remember, accuracy is low here because we are not taking advantage of the pre-trained weights as they cannot be downloaded in the kernel. This means we are training the wights from scratch and I we have only run 1 epoch due to the hardware constraints in the kernel.
# 
# Next we will make our predictions.

# In[ ]:


preds = model.predict(x_test, verbose=1)

sub = pd.DataFrame(preds)
# Set column names to those generated by the one-hot encoding earlier

sub.columns = col_names
# Insert the column id from the sample_submission at the start of the data frame
