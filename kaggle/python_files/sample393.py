# # Planet: Understanding the Amazon deforestation from Space challenge

# > The repo has been updated on 21-07-2017 with the latest code which allowed us to reach position 127 on the private LB with a score of 0.92837 (the 1st competitor has `0.93318`). It's far from being the best one but as it's our first kernel we're still proud of it. This competition was an amazing experience. Thanks everyone.

# Special thanks to the kernel contributors of this challenge (especially @anokas and @Kaggoo) who helped us find a starting point for this notebook.
