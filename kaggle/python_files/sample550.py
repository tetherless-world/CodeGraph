# # A Whirlwind Tour of Python
# 
# *Jake VanderPlas, Summer 2016*
# 
# These are the Jupyter Notebooks behind my O'Reilly report,
# [*A Whirlwind Tour of Python*](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp).
# The full notebook listing is available [on Github](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython).
# 
# *A Whirlwind Tour of Python* is a fast-paced introduction to essential
# components of the Python language for researchers and developers who are
# already familiar with programming in another language.
# 
# The material is particularly aimed at those who wish to use Python for data 
# science and/or scientific programming, and in this capacity serves as an
# introduction to my upcoming book, *[The Python Data Science Handbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do)*.
# These notebooks are adapted from lectures and workshops I've given on these
# topics at University of Washington and at various conferences, meetings, and
# workshops around the world.
