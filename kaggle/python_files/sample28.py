# ##Hi all as we know credit card fraud detection will have a imbalanced data i.e having more number of normal class than the number of fraud class
# 
# ###In this I will use Basic method of handling imbalance data which are
#  ** This all I have done by using Analytics Vidya's blog please find the link [Analytics Vidya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/read-commonly-used-formats-using-python/)  **
# 
# Undersampling:- it means taking the less number of majority class (In our case taking less number of Normal transactions so that our new data will be balanced
# 
# Oversampling: it means using replicating the data of minority class (fraud class) so that we can have a balanced data
# 
# SMOTE: it is also a type of oversampling but in this we will make the synthetic example of Minority data and will give as a balanced data
# 
# First I will start with the Undersampling and will try to classify using these Models
# 1. Decision Tree Classifier/ Random Forest Classifier
# 
# 2. Logistic regression
# 
# 3. SVM
# 
# 4. XGboost

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# ###Lets start with Importing Libraries and data

data = pd.read_csv("../input/creditcard.csv",header = 0)

# ####Now explore the data to get insight in it

# In[ ]:


data.info()

# 1. Hence we can see there are 284,807 rows and 31 columns which is a huge data
# 2.  Time is also in float here mean it can be only seconds starting from a particular time

# In[ ]:


# Now lets check the class distributions
sns.countplot("Class",data=data)

# 1. As we know data is imbalanced and this graph also confirmed it 

# In[ ]:


# now let us check in the number of Percentage
Count_Normal_transacation = len(data[data["Class"]==0]) # normal transaction are repersented by 0
Count_Fraud_transacation = len(data[data["Class"]==1]) # fraud by 1
Percentage_of_Normal_transacation = Count_Normal_transacation/(Count_Normal_transacation+Count_Fraud_transacation)
print("percentage of normal transacation is",Percentage_of_Normal_transacation*100)
Percentage_of_Fraud_transacation= Count_Fraud_transacation/(Count_Normal_transacation+Count_Fraud_transacation)
print("percentage of fraud transacation",Percentage_of_Fraud_transacation*100)

# 1. Hence in data there is only 0.17 % are the fraud transcation while 99.83 are valid transcation
# 2. So now we have to do resampling of this data
# 3. before doing resampling lets have look at the amount related to valid transcation and fraud transcation

# In[ ]:


Fraud_transacation = data[data["Class"]==1]
Normal_transacation= data[data["Class"]==0]
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.subplot(121)
Fraud_transacation.Amount.plot.hist(title="Fraud Transacation")
plt.subplot(122)
Normal_transacation.Amount.plot.hist(title="Normal Transaction")

# In[ ]:


# the distribution for Normal transction is not clear and it seams that all transaction are less than 2.5 K
# So plot graph for same 
Fraud_transacation = data[data["Class"]==1]
Normal_transacation= data[data["Class"]==0]
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.subplot(121)
Fraud_transacation[Fraud_transacation["Amount"]<= 2500].Amount.plot.hist(title="Fraud Tranascation")
plt.subplot(122)
Normal_transacation[Normal_transacation["Amount"]<=2500].Amount.plot.hist(title="Normal Transaction")

# 1. Here now after exploring data we can say there is no pattern in data
# 2. Now lets start with resmapling of data

# ###ReSampling - Under Sampling

# Before re sampling lets have look at the different accuracy matrices
# 
# Accuracy = TP+TN/Total
# 
# Precison = TP/(TP+FP)
# 
# Recall = TP/(TP+FN)
# 
# TP = True possitive means no of possitve cases which are predicted possitive
# 
# TN = True negative means no of negative cases which are predicted negative
# 
# FP = False possitve means no of negative cases which are predicted possitive
# 
# FN= False Negative means no of possitive cases which are predicted negative
# 
# Now for our case recall will be a better option because in these case no of normal transacations will be very high than the no of fraud cases and sometime a fraud case will be predicted as normal. So, recall will give us a sense of only fraud cases
# 
# Resampling
# 
# in this we will resample our data with different size
# 
# then we will try to use this resampled data to train our model
# 
# then we will use this model to predict for our original data

# In[ ]:


# for undersampling we need a portion of majority class and will take whole data of minority class
# count fraud transaction is the total number of fraud transaction
# now lets us see the index of fraud cases
fraud_indices= np.array(data[data.Class==1].index)
normal_indices = np.array(data[data.Class==0].index)
#now let us a define a function for make undersample data with different proportion
#different proportion means with different proportion of normal classes of data
def undersample(normal_indices,fraud_indices,times):#times denote the normal data = times*fraud data
    Normal_indices_undersample = np.array(np.random.choice(normal_indices,(times*Count_Fraud_transacation),replace=False))
    undersample_data= np.concatenate([fraud_indices,Normal_indices_undersample])
    undersample_data = data.iloc[undersample_data,:]
    
    print("the normal transacation proportion is :",len(undersample_data[undersample_data.Class==0])/len(undersample_data[undersample_data.Class]))
    print("the fraud transacation proportion is :",len(undersample_data[undersample_data.Class==1])/len(undersample_data[undersample_data.Class]))

# here 1st proportion conatain 50% normal transaction
#Proportion 2nd contains 66% noraml transaction
#proportion 3rd contains 75 % normal transaction

#  1. As the number of normal transaction is increasing the recall for fraud transcation is decreasing
#  2. TP = no of fraud transaction which are predicted fraud
#  3.  TN = no. of normal transaction which are predicted normal
#  4.  FP =  no of normal transaction which are predicted fraud

#let us train this model using undersample data and test for the whole data test set

    print("_________________________________________________________________________________________")

# 1. Here we can see it is following same recall pattern as it  was for under sample data that's sounds good but if we have look at the precision is very less
# 
# 2. So we should built a model which is correct overall
# 
# 3. Precision is less means we are predicting other class wrong like as for our third part  there were 953 transaction are predicted fraud it means we and recall is good then it means we are catching fraud transaction very well but we are catching innocent transaction also i.e which are not fraud.
# 
# 4. So with recall our precision should be better
# 
# 5. if we go by this model then we are going to put 953 innocents in jail with the all criminal who have actually done this
# 6. Hence we are mainly lacking in the precision how can we increase our precision
# 7. Don't get confuse with above output showing that the two training data and two test data first one is for undersample data  while another one is for our whole data

# 1.**Try with SVM and then Random Forest in same Manner**
# 
# 2. from Random forest we can get which features are more important

# *SVM with Undersample data*

# ###Over Sampling

#  1. In my previous version I got the 100 recall and 98 % precision by using Random forest with the over sampled data but in real it was due to over fitting because i was taking whole fraud data and was training for that and I was doing the testing on the same data.
# 
#  2. Please find link of previous version for more understanding [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/gargmanish/d/dalpozz/creditcardfraud/fraud-detection-100-recall-98-precision/run/1033018)

# 
#  1. Now here we can see recall decrease to only 83 % which is not bad  but not good also
#  2. The precision is 0.93 which is good 
#  3. from these observation we can say that the oversampling is better than the Under sampling because on Under sampling we were loosing a large amount of data or we can say a good amount of information so why the there precision was very low

#  1. By using Smote we are getting a 50 - 50 each
# 
#  2. No need of checking here in over sampled data itself from previous we know it will be overfitting
# 
#  3. let us check with the test data direct
