import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

Question 2
Simplifying A and B will give us:
    4 log n = n
Where A is (4 log n) and B is (n)
By plugging in values for n (i.e. exponents of 2),
A will always be greater than B up until n = 16.
Therefore, A will run faster when n is greater or equal to 16.

"""
Question 3
Using the definition of the big Oh notation,
since d(n) = O(f(n)), we have positive c and n0
a*d (n) <= a*c*f(n) for n => n0
give c2 = a*c
a*d(n) <= c2f(n) for all n => n0
That makes a*d(n) = O(f(n))
