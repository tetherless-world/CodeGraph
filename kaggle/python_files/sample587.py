# ### The results of the quick LSTM are promising. 
# 
# On the first try with no hyperparameter search, 6th epoch, max sequence length cut down to a measly 2000 (longest text has 77000+ words), we get the best log loss so far of around 1.4. You can still see a bit of bias towards class 7 but the confusion matrix looks more balanced than anything we've seen so far.
# 
# ### Further tuning of the LSTM will likely produce better results.

# ## So far, we've only used the text field to perform classification. But there is still the "Gene" and "Variation" fields.
# 
# Using only the Text field is a bit flawed. Looking closer at the statistics we calculated above, "training_text" actually has duplicates, and the duplicates have different classes. This is part of the challenge. A lot of papers are studies of 2 or more genes. It is our job to use the other fields to figure out which parts of the text are relevant for the particular Gene and Variation.

# ## Summary
# 
# The aim of this notebook was to do some quick exploration of the dataset and apply some common ML techniques to the classification task. The metric to maximize is multiclass log loss.
# 
# A big part of the problem is to teach an ML model how to "read" medical literature and classify the given Gene and Variation into 1 out of 9 classes.
# 
# Thus, the first part of this notebook focused on applying common techniques to preprocess and vectorize free text and evaluate its effectiveness by running them through vanilla Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
# 
# The techniques used, from least effective to most effective, were:
# 
# * Bag of Words
# * TF-IDF
# * Word2Vec
# 
# Because the above approaches did not take into account the temporal patterns in free text, a quick LSTM was tried as well. This approach scored higher than the above without any tuning.
# 
# In the second part of the notebook, I added the "Gene" and "Variation" features next to the free text features. I tried both label encoding and one-hot encoding, however, the results did not show much improvement.
# 
# In the third part of the notebook, I generated submissions for both Word2Vec (multiple classifiers) and Keras LSTM and recorded the public leaderboard scores of each submission. The scores were better (around 1) but did not show the same relationships with each other as my own CV (they were mostly close to each other). This is a common occurrence in Kaggle competitions since the public leaderboard is scored on a smaller subset of the test data. Most Kagglers' advice is to ignore the public leaderboard and trust your own CV.
# 
# ## Further things to try
# 
# This notebook's aim was mostly figuring out which techniques are worth exploring and was not intended to generate very competitive submissions. The following is a list of suggestions to try for further improvement.
# 
# * There are tons of other techniques for free text other than the ones I listed above. Make sure to explore other techniques such as Doc2Vec, DeepIR, and Word Mover's distance
# 
# * Focus more on capturing the relationship between "Gene" and "Variation" with the free text features. Since "Text" is sometimes duplicated (with different classes!), taking into account "Gene" and "Variation" is very important.
# 
# * Explore different deep learning architectures for the data. One idea for an architecture is to combine a simple Embedding + LSTM for the free text and concatenate the input with "Gene" and "Variation" Embeddings, leading into a final fully connected layer for the classes. Hopefully, this will capture the relationship between the text and the "Gene" + "Variation" columns.
# 
# * Train Word2Vec on a bigger corpus of genetic and medical data. Since Word2Vec is unsupervised, we can get better embeddings with more data, and consequently, better predictions
# 
# * Don't forget to do hyperparameter optimization when you're happy with a set of features. Stacked ensembling is also an almost guaranteed way to get a small boost to your score. We skipped this entirely in this notebook as this is usually the last step in the process. Try http://xcessiv.readthedocs.io/.
