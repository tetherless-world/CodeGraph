# ### Read images
# First, I'll just read all the images. The images are in BGR (Blue/Green/Red) format because OpenCV uses this.
# 
# Btw... If you'd like to use RGB format, than you can use it, it won't effect the segmentation because we will use the HSV (Hue/Saturation/Value) color space for that.

    sensitivity = 35
    lower_hsv = np.array([60 - sensitivity, 100, 50])
    upper_hsv = np.array([60 + sensitivity, 255, 255])

    mask = cv2.inRange(image_hsv, lower_hsv, upper_hsv)
    kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (11,11))
    mask = cv2.morphologyEx(mask, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)
    
    return mask

def segment_plant(image):
    mask = create_mask_for_plant(image)
    output = cv2.bitwise_and(image, image, mask = mask)
    return output

def sharpen_image(image):
    image_blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (0, 0), 3)

# The `create_mask_for_plant` function: This function returns an image mask: Matrix with shape `(image_height, image_width)`. In this matrix there are only `0` and `1` values. The 1 values define the interesting part of the original image. But the question is...How do we create this mask?
# 
# This is a simple object detection problem, where we can use the color of the object.
# 
# The HSV color-space is suitable for color detection because with the Hue we can define the color and the saturation and value will define "different kinds" of the color. (For example it will detect the red, darker red, lighter red too). We cannot do this with the original BGR color space.

# 
# *image from https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/convert-from-hsv-to-rgb-color-space.html*
# 
# We have to set a range, which color should be detected:
# 
#     sensitivity = 35
#     lower_hsv = np.array([60 - sensitivity, 100, 50])
#     upper_hsv = np.array([60 + sensitivity, 255, 255])
#     
# After the mask is created with the `inRange` function, we can do a little *CV magic* (not close to magic, because this is almost the most basic thing in CV, but it is a cool buzzword, and this opertation is as awesome as simple it is) which is called *morphological operations* ([You can read more here](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci773s1c/lectures/ImageProcessing-html/topic4.htm)).
# 
# Basically with the *Close* operation we would like to keep the shape of the original objects (1 blobs on the mask image) but close the small holes. That way we can clarify our detection mask more.

# After these steps we created the mask for the object.

image_mask = create_mask_for_plant(image)
image_segmented = segment_plant(image)
image_sharpen = sharpen_image(image_segmented)

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(20, 20))
axs[0].imshow(image)
axs[1].imshow(image_mask)
axs[2].imshow(image_segmented)
axs[3].imshow(image_sharpen)

# After this step we can see that the image on the right is more recognizable than the original image on the left.

# ----------------------------------------------

# From the mask image what we created (because we need that for the segmentation), we can extract some features. For example we can see how the area of the plant changes based on their classes.

# Of course from the contours we can extract much more information than the area of the
# contour and the number of components, but this is the one I would like to show you.
