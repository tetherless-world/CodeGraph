# Welcome All, below I intend to demonstrate the simulated implementation of one of the most famous trading strategies on the open bitcoin dataset kindly shared here. I will flag up some of the many gotchas in this type of simulation. The strategy is attributed to Richard Dennis and his team of "turtle" traders, check out the book "Way of the Turtle" for more details.
# 
# Note I would strongly recommend that you not actually trade this, this is purely a simple example to highlight various tricks and pitfalls with the data. This kernel does not consitute trading or financial advice in anyway. Bitcoin is a particularly volatile market with some unique challenges and not the place to start in my limited opinion if you are interested in algorithmic trading.
# 
# This is a work in progress, please comment if you'd like to see more and I will extend it for the execution simulation

# The first thing we need are our trading signals. The Turtle strategy was based on daily data and
# they used to enter breakouts (new higher highs or new lower lows) in the 22-60 day range roughly.
# We are dealing with minute bars here so a 22 minute new high isn't much to get excited about. Lets
# pick an equivalent to 60 days then. They also only considered Close price so lets do the same...
