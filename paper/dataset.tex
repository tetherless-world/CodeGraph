\subsection{Dataset}

We used Google's BigQuery public GitHub dataset of over 3 million open source projects\footnote{\url{https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/github/github-repos?filter=solution-type:dataset&q=github&id=46ee22ab-2ca4-4750-81a7-3ee0f0150dcb}} to extract Python files or Python notebooks that import SciKit Learn\footnote{Note that SciKit Learn is one of the more popular data science libraries, and as we showed in the turtles we included, this does tend to include many other popular data science libraries such as SciPy, TensorFlow, etc.}.  This query yielded 9489 files. Of these, we kept only the files that could be parsed by a Python 3 or Python 2 parser.  Duplicate files were eliminated, with duplicates defined as files with the same MD5 hashcode.  This yielded 6671 files, 6474 files of which could be successfully analyzed by our framework for a 97.04\% success rate. Most files were analyzed within a second, with a few taking a few minutes.
