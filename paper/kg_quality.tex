\section{Quality of the Knowledge graph}
The knowledge graph we constructed had approximately 16 million edges.  To assess the quality of the knowledge graph, we evaluated two important characteristics: (a) the quality of the analysis coverage; i.e., to what extent was analysis able to cover the code present in the files, (b) the generalizability of the knowledge graph to unseen programs.  We cover each in the subsections below.
