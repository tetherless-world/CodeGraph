\section{Granularity of knowledge graph}
Here we talk about what we want in a knowledge graph for code - what do we represent and how.  E.g., how do we define the interesting nodes of our graph - basically turtles which we define in a data driven way (imports of libraries that are 'popular').
\section{Mining usage patterns}
\input{example.tex}

\subsection{validation of the knowledge graph}
Hold back 10\% edges of the graph, can we predict the other 90\%
\section{Mining Documentation associated with code}
This section will contain mining docstrings, associating it with turtles using inferencing?, mining RST/MD files, mining Stack overflow
\subsection{validation of the documentation?? how might we validate?}
\section{WhyIs} An introduction to what is our framework for the graph, and why we need such a framework.  What are the pieces of functionality on the graph that this enables. Visualization, demo, query access, provenance 
\section{statistics on the knowledge graph}
How many nodes and edges are in the graph, how many are connected to doc, how many are connected to usage etc
